# Tree Data Structure
The Trie data structure is a tree-like data structure used for storing a dynamic set of strings.
It is commonly used for efficient retrieval and storage of keys in a large dataset. The structure supports operations
such as insertion, search, and deletion of keys, making it a valuable tool in fields like computer science 
and information retrieval.

## Representation of of Trie Node
A Trie data structure consists of nodes connected by edges. Each node represents a character or a part of a string. 
The root node, the starting point of the Trie, represents an empty string. Each edge emanating from a node signifies a specific character.
The path from the root to a node represents the prefix of a string stored in the Trie.
