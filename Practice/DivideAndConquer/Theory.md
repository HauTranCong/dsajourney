# Divide and Conquer
The Divide and Conquer algorithm is a design paradigm used to solve complex problems 
by breaking them down into smaller, simpler subproblems, solving each subproblem independently, 
and then combining the results

## Steps in Divide and Conquer
1. Divide: Split the problem into smaller subproblems that are similar to the original but smaller in size.
2. Conquer: Solve the subproblems recursively. If the subproblem is small enough (base case), solve it directly.
3. Combine: Merge the results of the subproblems to form the solution to the original problem.
