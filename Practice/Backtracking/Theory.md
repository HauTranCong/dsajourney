## Backtracking Algorithm
Backtracking is a problem-solving paradigm that is often used in algorithms involving decision-making, 
search spaces, and constraint satisfaction problems. It can be understood as an enhanced version 
of brute-force search with pruning. To grasp it fully, we need to explore both the algorithmic process
and its underlying mathematical foundations.

## Algorithmic Concept of Backtracking
Backtracking is an incremental search technique that tries to solve a problem by building a solution step-by-step.
It explores all possible configurations (solution space) recursively, abandoning configurations that are bound to fail ("backtracking") and only continuing with the ones that seem feasible at each step.

## Key Elements:
1. Candidate solution: The partial solution we are currently building.
2. Feasibility test (Constraints): At each step, we test whether the candidate solution satisfies
the constraints of the problem.
3. Solution completion: The process ends when a complete solution is found, 
or all possible candidates are explored.
